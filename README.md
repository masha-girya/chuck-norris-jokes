# Chuck Norris Jokes APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**[DEMO-LINK](https://masha-girya.github.io/chuck-norris-jokes)**;

This app generates one random Chuck's joke. You can choose a category for which a joke will be generated or you can choose random category.
Each joke loads from [API](https://api.chucknorris.io/#!)

After loading joke is memorized to the session storage so if you accidentally reload the tab, don't worry, the joke remains, so you can show it to your friends :)
